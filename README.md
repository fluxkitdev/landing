# ⚡ FluxKit

> *"Where we're going, we don't need roads... but we do need a solid infrastructure!"* 🚗💨

Welcome to **FluxKit** - the modular open-source infrastructure that's basically the DeLorean of developer toolkits. Just like Doc Brown's flux capacitor, we've got the power to make your apps travel through time (well, at least make development feel like it's from the future).

## 🔌 What the Flux?

FluxKit is a modular infrastructure built with **wires** (because who doesn't love a good Back to the Future reference?). Each wire is a self-contained module that you can plug into your app faster than Marty can say "Great Scott!"

Think of it as LEGO blocks for developers, but instead of building a castle, you're building the next unicorn startup. 🦄

## 🧩 The Wires (Modules)

### ⚡ **Core Wire**

The essential npm package that powers all other wires. Think of it as the flux capacitor that makes everything else work:

- 🗄️ Database operations (the backbone of any app)
- 🔐 Crypto functions (hashing, encryption, digital signatures)
- 🛠️ Utility functions (shared helpers and common operations)
- 📊 Data validation (ensuring your data is as reliable as Doc's calculations)
- 🔧 Configuration management (centralized settings for all wires)
- 📝 Logging and monitoring (because even time machines need maintenance)
- 🌐 HTTP client utilities (for when wires need to talk to each other)

*This is the only wire that's an npm package - all others are REST APIs that import and use the Core Wire.*

### 🔐 **Auth Wire**

Everything you need to handle users without losing your sanity:
- Login/logout (obviously)
- Password resets (the bane of every developer's existence)
- Social auth (because typing passwords is so 2010)
- JWT tokens (the digital equivalent of a hall pass)
- Session management (for when you need to keep track of your users)
- Magic links (for 2025 auth systems)

### 📱 **Messaging Wire**

Communicate with your users across all channels:
- 📧 Email (the OG of digital communication)
- 📱 WhatsApp (because everyone's on it)
- 💬 SMS (for when you really need to reach someone)
- 🚀 And more channels coming soon (telegram, discord, carrier pigeons...)

### 🗄️ **Store Wire**

Upload, store, and manage all your data:
- File uploads (images, documents, cat videos)
- Database operations (CRUD without the tears)
- Data validation (because users will always find a way to break things)
- Backup and recovery (for when things go wrong)

### 💳 **Pay Wire**

Handle payments like a time-traveling financial wizard:
- 💳 Stripe integration (the gold standard)
- 🐚 PayPal (for the traditionalists)
- ⛓️ On-chain transactions (for the crypto enthusiasts)
- 💰 Multi-currency support (because the world is bigger than your local currency)

### ⛓️ **OnChain Wire**

Everything blockchain-related without the headache:
- Smart contract interactions
- Wallet connections
- Transaction management
- NFT operations (because digital art is still art)

### 🎨 **UI Wire**

React components that don't make you want to time travel back to before you started coding:
- Pre-built components (because reinventing the wheel is so 1985)
- Consistent design system
- Responsive by default
- Accessible (because everyone deserves good UX)

## 🚀 How It Works

Everything (except UI) is a **REST API** that you can call from anywhere. It's like having a Swiss Army knife, but for your backend infrastructure.

### 🔬 Experimental: MCP Support

We're also experimenting with **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** support, because why not make your infrastructure AI-friendly? It's like giving your flux capacitor a brain upgrade.
